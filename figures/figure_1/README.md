The differential impact of m6A reader knockout on various RNA species. The log fold change in expression of genes
of interest were compared between long non-coding and coding RNAs (a) and plotted as a density curve. The log fold change
in expression of these genes were then compared for coding (b) long non-coding (b) RNAs separately with varying numbers of
m6A sites present (0, 1, 2-4, 5+).
