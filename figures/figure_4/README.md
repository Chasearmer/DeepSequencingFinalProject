The relationship betwOur analytical approach employed two distinct visualizations: the first (a) delineates the indepen-
dent frequency distributions of housekeeping versus non-housekeeping genes across m6A modification count bins, normalized
within each category to facilitate intra-category comparisons. The second (b) represents the proportional distribution of house-
keeping and non-housekeeping genes within each m6A count bin, thereby enabling an inter-category comparison.
