We used GSE147849 as our source data. In this dataset, mouse embryonic stem cells (strain: KH2) were knocked-out of each of the following proteins: METTL3, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and YTHDF1/2/3 triple-KO. RNA-seq was generated in each of these KOs and in WT, with two replicates for each condition. RNA-seq libraries were prepared by extracting total RNAs first and then purifying for polyadenylated RNA. Single-end sequencing data was obtained from NextSeq 550.
