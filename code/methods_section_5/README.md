### Housekeeping Gene Selection
For this study, we utilized a dataset of housekeeping genes, obtained from the Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas (https://housekeeping.unicamp.br). Housekeeping genes, essential for the maintenance of basic cellular functions, are expected to be expressed uniformly across all cell types and developmental stages. In our analysis, a housekeeping gene is defined as one exhibiting at least one protein-coding transcript with a consistent presence in all analyzed cell types or tissues, maintaining a non-zero expression level. The selection criteria for these genes were stringent: they must be expressed at a level above 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase million) in every tissue and cell type studied, exhibit low expression variability (standard deviation of log2 RPKM < 1), and have a maximum fold change (MFC) less than 2. Additionally, only genes without known pseudogenes and having well-supported transcript models were included.

### Data Preparation and Analysis
We employed our custom Python script, get_housekeeping_genes.py, to segregate housekeeping genes from non-housekeeping genes within our dataset. This script was executed on datasets obtained from mouse embryonic stem cells (strain: KH2) subjected to METTL3 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) conditions. The script identifies housekeeping genes based on their presence in the Housekeeping Genes list and partitions the dataset accordingly into housekeepers and non-housekeepers.

### m6A Modification Pattern Analysis
To visualize the influence of m6A modifications on these gene categories, we developed two Python scripts for data visualization: plot_m6a_histogram_housekeepers.py and plot_m6a_housekeepers_barplot.py. The first script generates histograms comparing the frequency of m6A modifications in housekeeping versus non-housekeeping genes. The second script provides a stacked bar plot to exhibit the proportional distribution of m6A gene counts within each category. These visualizations aid in understanding the relationship between m6A modification frequency and the regulatory stringency of housekeeping genes, as well as their differential expression in response to METTL3 knockout.
