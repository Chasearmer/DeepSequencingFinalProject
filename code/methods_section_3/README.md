Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis were performed using DESeq2 (version 1.42.0) in R (version 4.3). The number of m6A sites on each gene in mESC was annotated using the comprehensive m6A knowledgebase m6A-Atlas v2.0, which contains 266,643 m6A sites detected in mouse using 7 high-resolution technologies. The biotype of each gene was annotated using the mm10 gene annotation file from GENCODE. The density plots and cumulative distribution function plots were generated with ggplot2 (version 3.4.4) in R.
